# Images

### Responsive images

Images in Bootstrap are made responsive with `.img-fluid`. `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` are applied to the image so that it scales with the parent element.

### Image thumbnails

In addition to our border-radius utilities, you can use `.img-thumbnail` to give an image a rounded 1px border appearance.
